# ✅ BLANK PAGE ISSUE - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong?

The React app was built with **absolute paths** (`/static/js/...`) which don't work with Android's `file://` protocol.

## What I Fixed

✅ Added `"homepage": "."` to package.json
✅ Rebuilt frontend with **relative paths** (`./static/js/...`)
✅ Copied new build to Android assets folder

---

## 🚀 NOW REBUILD YOUR APK

### In Android Studio:

1. **Clean the project first:**
   - Menu: **Build** → **Clean Project**
   - Wait for it to complete

2. **Rebuild the project:**
   - Menu: **Build** → **Rebuild Project**
   - Wait for completion (2-3 minutes)

3. **Build new APK:**
   - Menu: **Build** → **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** → **Build APK(s)**
   - Wait for build

4. **Install new APK on phone:**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Uninstall the old version first!
   - Copy new APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
   - Install on phone

---

## ✅ App Should Now Work!

After installing the new APK, your app should:
- ✅ Show the M.Pump Calc dashboard
- ✅ Display all UI elements properly
- ✅ Work completely offline
- ✅ Allow adding/editing records
- ✅ Export PDFs correctly

## 🔍 If Still Blank Page

### Try This Debug Method:

1. Connect phone via USB
2. Enable USB Debugging on phone
3. In Android Studio: **View** → **Tool Windows** → **Logcat**
4. Filter by package: `com.mpumpcalc.app`
5. Look for errors in the logs
6. Share the error message if any

### Common Additional Fixes:

**Issue: Console shows "Failed to load resource"**
- Solution: Make sure all files in `/app/android/app/src/main/assets/` are present
- Check: `assets/static/js/` and `assets/static/css/` folders exist

**Issue: "Cross-origin request blocked"**
- Solution: Already handled in MainActivity.java with proper settings

**Issue: WebView settings**
- Solution: Already configured correctly in the code

## 📝 What Changed in Files

### package.json
```json
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "homepage": ".",    ← THIS WAS ADDED
  ...
}
```

### index.html (before)
```html
<script src="/static/js/main.fb120c81.js"></script>
<link href="/static/css/main.28eed18f.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### index.html (after) ✅
```html
<script src="./static/js/main.d8752606.js"></script>
<link href="./static/css/main.28eed18f.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

The `./` prefix makes paths relative, which works with `file://` protocol!

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT STEPS

1. **Uninstall old APK** from phone before installing new one
2. **Clean Project** in Android Studio before rebuilding
3. **Wait for Gradle sync** to complete
4. **Don't skip** the clean step!
